# Hi there, I'm Chisom Havilah Ibeh 

## Machine Learning Engineer | Building Intelligent Systems

I'm an ML enthusiast focused on building production-ready machine learning systems. Currently pursuing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning) at Liverpool John Moores University, with a strong focus on taking models from notebooks to deployment.

###  What I'm Working On
- Building end-to-end ML pipelines from data processing to deployment
- Deep learning projects using PyTorch and TensorFlow
- MLOps: containerization, model serving, and monitoring
- Image classification and NLP applications
